# Dental FAQs

A simple Flask-based web application that allows users to ask questions related to dental care and get answers generated by an AI model. It also includes functionality to display relevant PubMed articles, and optionally, generate dental images based on user-selected categories.

## Features
- **Ask Questions:** Users can ask dental-related questions and get answers.
- **PubMed Article Search:** Users can search for dental-related articles from PubMed.
- **History:** Users can view the history of their asked questions.
- **Dental Image Generation:** (Planned Feature) Users can generate dental-related images by selecting a category.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the application.
- **BM25 Algorithm:** For ranking articles based on relevance to the user's question.
- **PubMed API:** To retrieve dental-related research articles.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For building the frontend of the application.
- **NLTK:** For text tokenization and processing.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dental-qa.git
   cd dental-qa
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   Your app should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

- **Ask a Question:** In the "Ask Question" tab, type your dental care-related question and click "Get Answer."
- **Search Articles:** In the "Articles" tab, type a search query related to dental care to find relevant research articles.
- **View History:** You can view the history of your asked questions in the sidebar.

## Deployment

You can deploy this application using platforms like **Heroku** or **GitHub Pages**. Here's how to deploy it using **Heroku**:

1. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) (if not already installed).
2. Login to Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```
3. Create a new Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create dental-qa-app
   ```
4. Add the changes to your Git repository and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push heroku master
   ```

   After deployment, Heroku will provide a URL where your app is hosted.

## Future Features

- **Dental Image Generation:** Users can select an image category to generate dental images using a free pretrained model (TBD).
- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication so users can save their history and favorite articles.
